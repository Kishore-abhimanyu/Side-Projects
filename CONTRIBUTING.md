# How to Contribute

THANK YOU FOR considering to contributing to this project! :smile:

## You can fix bugs in my codes! 

- Find a Bug and Report and [ISSUE](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/issues/32)

## Submitting Changes

Send a clear Pull Request **mentioning** the changes you made in the code.

Always write  a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```bash
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
