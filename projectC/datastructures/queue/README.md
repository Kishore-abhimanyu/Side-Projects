#### Implementation of a queue using Linked List: [C](C_LL) & [C++](Cplus_LL)

- [x] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
  - [x] enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
  - [x] dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
  - [x] empty()

#### Implementation of a queue using Arrays: [C](C_ARRAY)

- [x] Implement using fixed-sized array:
  - [x] enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
  - [x] dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
  - [ ] empty()
