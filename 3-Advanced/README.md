Networking
---------

- [ ] **FTP Program** - A file transfer program which can transfer files back and forth from a remote web sever.

- [ ] **Bandwidth Monitor** - A small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session. See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.

- [ ] **Port Scanner** - Enter an IP address and a port range where the program will then attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.

- [ ] **Mail Checker (POP3 / IMAP)** - The user enters various account information include web server and IP, protocol type (POP3 or IMAP) and the application will check for email at a given interval.

Threading
---------

- [ ] **Create A Progress Bar for Downloads** - Create a progress bar for applications that can keep track of a download in progress. The progress bar will be on a separate thread and will communicate with the main thread using delegates.

Create an image program which can take hundreds of images and converts them to a specified size in the background thread while you do other things. For added complexity, have one thread handling re-sizing, have another bulk renaming of thumbnails etc.

Web
---------

- [ ] **Get Atomic Time from Internet Clock** - This program will get the true atomic time from an atomic time clock on the Internet. Use any one of the atomic clocks returned by a simple Google search.

- [ ] **Fetch Current Weather** - Get the current weather for a given zip/postal code. *Optional: Try locating the user automatically.*

- [ ] **Scheduled Auto Login and Action** - Make an application which logs into a given site on a schedule and invokes a certain action and then logs out. This can be useful for checking web mail, posting regular content, or getting info for other applications and saving it to your computer.

Security
-------------

- [ ] **Caesar cipher** - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
