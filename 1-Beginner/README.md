#### Projects from [karan's repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects/)

- [x] **Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
- [x] [**Prime Factorization**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/sieve_of_Eratosthenes) - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
- [x] [**Next Prime Number**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/sieve_of_Eratosthenes) - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
- [x] [**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/tiles) - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
- [x] **Change Return Program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.
- [x] [**Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/unit_converter) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.
- [x] **Factorial Finder** - The Factorial of a positive integer, `n`, is defined as the product of the sequence `n, n-1, n-2, ...1` and the factorial of `zero`, `0`, is defined as being `1`. Solve this using both loops and recursion.
- [x] **Complex Number Algebra** - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.
- [x] [**Coin Flip Simulation**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/coin_flip_simulation) - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.
- [x] [**Sieve of Eratosthenes**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/sieve_of_Eratosthenes) - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).
- [x] [**Fizz Buzz**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/text) - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
- [x] [**Reverse a String**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/text) - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.
- [x] [**Count Vowels**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/text) - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.
- [x] [**Check if Palindrome**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/text) - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”
- [x] [**Count Words in a String**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/text) - Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.

- [x] [**Binary to Decimal and Back Converter**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App) - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
- [x] [**Color Cycle**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/color_cycle) - Cycle a color value through incremental changes
- [x] [**Countdown Timer**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/countdown_timer) - Event Countdown timer
- [x] [**Calculator**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/calculator) - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.
- [x] [**CSV2JSON**](csv2json) - Converts CSV file format to JSON file format
- [x] [**Dollars to Cents**](https://github.com/kana800/Side-Projects/tree/master/1-Beginner/dollars_to_cents) - Converting Dollars to Cents
